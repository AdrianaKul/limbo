Gaussian process regression benchmarks
======================================

*October 06, 2017* -- hal14 (32 cores)

- We compare to GPy (https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) 
- Mean Squared Error: lower is better
- Learning time: lower is better
- Querying time (for 1 by 1 query points): lower is better

- In each replicate, all the variants (see below for the variants available) are using exactly the same data

Naming convention
------------------

- GP-SE-Full: Limbo with Squared Exponential kernel where the signal noise, signal variance and kernel lengthscales are optimized via Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- GP-SE: Same as above but the signal noise is not optimized and set to a default value: 0.01
- GPy: GPy with Squared Exponential kernel where the signal noise, signal variance and kernel lengthscales are optimized via Maximum Likelihood Estimation
